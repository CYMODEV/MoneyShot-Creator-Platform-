## Product Overview

### 1. MoneyShot Competition Social Platform

The MoneyShot platform establishes a creator-centric social media arena that enables anyone to launch, sponsor, or participate in tokenized media challenges—integrating partner brands, real-world rewards, and on-chain voting or tipping mechanics. Users create, share, and compete via video, image, and mixed-media submissions, while programmable tokens fuel entry, support, and prize disbursement. Unlike legacy social media or contest tools, every competition is digitally transparent, instantly rewarding, and settled on-chain, cementing user trust and engagement.

Distinctive Features:

- Multi-channel media contest creation and discovery (video, photo, branded challenges)
- Tokenized entry, on-chain prize pools, and programmable winnings (including fiat or PEG tokens)
- Creator monetization through tips, rewards, and shareable contest campaigns
- Integrated wallet and user reputation layer
- Frictionless partner integrations for co-branded or white-label competitions
- Automated compliance, anti-fraud, and transparent result reporting

### 2. PEG Token System: Stable, Asset-Backed Digital Currency

To power platform transactions and ensure market trust, MoneyShot introduces PEG—a stable digital asset backed by fiat reserves or short-term securities, employing on-chain transparency and rigorous governance standards. PEG enables frictionless entry and reward flows in competitions, cross-border remittances, partner platform integrations, and marketplace purchases or services, all without exposure to crypto volatility.

PEG Token Properties:

- 1:1 asset-backed with transparent, auditable reserves; redeemable via smart contracts
- Supports multi-currency backing and programmable settlement (atomic swaps, DvP)
- Designed with redemption schedules, circuit breakers, and insurance to minimize run risk
- Structured as an ERC-20 compatible asset for maximal wallet and ecosystem acceptance
- Compliant with trusted stablecoin best practices and regulatory requirements

### 3. Pixelated PEG Payment Code Generator with ChromaPixel Security

For payment verification, settlement, and fraud prevention, MoneyShot deploys its proprietary pixelated PEG payment code generator. Every transaction is encapsulated in a dynamically generated, color-coded code (QR/chromapixel) that includes tamper-evident and cryptographically secured elements. The system leverages multi-layered pixel validation and embedded data signatures, making codes not only scannable and platform-agnostic but also resistant to overlay, spoofing, or replay attacks.

Core Capabilities:

- Generates visually distinct, scan-ready payment codes reflecting transaction ID, amount, sender, and metadata
- ChromaPixel encoding: color, shape, and pixel patterning for both machine and human authentication
- Tamper-evident: visual cues indicate any code modification or duplication attempts
- Applicable for in-person, online, and remote payment flows, as well as for access ticketing or supply chain verification
- Easily integrated via API into POS, e-commerce, and mobile environments
- Secure, privacy-preserving, and GDPR/local data compliant
